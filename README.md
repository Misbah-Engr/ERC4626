# ERC4626
X Thread on Vaults

## 1/ What's the Big Deal? (The TL;DR)

Imagine you've got a magic box (a smart contract, duh!). You put your precious crypto in (like USDC, WETH, whatever). This box isn't just sitting there; it's *working* to earn you more crypto (yield!). You get "shares" of this box, representing your ownership.

ERC-4626 makes sure all these magic boxes work in a *predictable, standardized way*.  Before 4626, every vault had its own quirky rules. Now?  Smooth sailing! This is HUGE for making DeFi apps play nice together.

## 2/ Key Concepts:  Speaking the Vault Language

Let's break down the lingo, so you're not lost in the DeFi jungle:

*   **Underlying Asset:**  The crypto you're putting *into* the vault (e.g., USDC, WETH). Think of it as the "fuel" for the yield engine.
*   **Vault Shares:**  The token you get *back* from the vault. It's your "receipt" proving you own a piece of the action.  And guess what?  It's *also* an ERC-20 token!
*   **Deposit:**  The act of putting your underlying assets *into* the vault.  You get vault shares in return.
*   **Withdraw:**  Trading your vault shares *back* for your underlying assets (plus, hopefully, some sweet, sweet yield!).
*   **Mint/Redeem:**  These are kinda like deposit/withdraw, but they're often used *internally* by the vault.  Don't worry too much about these at first.

## 3/ Important Functions: The Spells You Cast

These are the functions (aka methods) you'll be using to interact with the vault. They're like the buttons you push to make things happen. Let's start simple:


// What's the underlying asset?  (Like, what kind of crypto are we dealing with?)
function asset() public view returns (address);

// How much of the underlying asset is in the vault *total*? (Including any yield!)
function totalAssets() public view returns (uint256);

asset() is super straightforward â€“ it just tells you the address of the token the vault is managing.  totalAssets() is where things get interesting: it shows you the total amount of that token held by the vault, and that includes any yield the vault has generated!
4/ More Functions:  Shares vs. Assets â€“ The Exchange Rate
These functions are crucial for figuring out the relationship between shares and assets:
// If I put in X amount of assets, how many *shares* would I get? (Theoretical)
function convertToShares(uint256 assets) public view returns (uint256);

// If I have Y number of shares, how many *assets* would I get back? (Theoretical)
function convertToAssets(uint256 shares) public view returns (uint256);

Think of these as a "pre-flight check." They give you an estimate of the exchange rate.  But keep in mind, they don't account for any fees or rounding that might happen during a real transaction.
5/ Even MORE Functions: Previewing the REAL Deal
This is where previewDeposit and previewWithdraw become your best friends. They're like the "estimated cost" screen you see before you confirm an Uber ride:
// How many shares will I *actually* get if I deposit X amount of assets? (The real deal!)
function previewDeposit(uint256 assets) public view returns (uint256);

// How many assets will I *actually* get back if I withdraw Y number of shares? (No surprises!)
function previewWithdraw(uint256 shares) public view returns (uint256);

These are way more accurate for understanding the outcome of a deposit or withdrawal. They take into account the vault's current state, any fees, and those pesky rounding issues.  Seriously, use these before you do anything!
6/ Max Functions:  Limits and Keeping Things Safe
These functions help protect you (and the vault!) from unpleasant surprises:

```solidity
function maxDeposit(address receiver) public view returns (uint256);
function maxMint(address receiver) public view returns (uint256);
function maxWithdraw(address owner) public view returns (uint256);
function maxRedeem(address owner) public view returns (uint256);
```

These tell you the maximum amount of assets/shares that can be deposited, minted, withdrawn, or redeemed.  They're super important for:
 * Vault Limits:  The vault might have a cap on how much it can hold in total.
 * Slippage Protection: You don't want to deposit a ton of crypto and then get a terrible exchange rate because the price changed while your transaction was processing.  These functions help prevent that!
7/ Building a Crazy Simple Vault (Seriously, Don't Use This in Production!)
Let's get our hands dirty! We'll use OpenZeppelin's library â€“ they've done a lot of the heavy lifting for us.


First, the basic setup:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC4626.sol";

contract MySimpleVault is ERC4626 {

    ERC20 public immutable asset; // This is where we store the underlying asset

    constructor(ERC20 _asset, string memory _name, string memory _symbol)
        ERC20(_name, _symbol) // The vault's shares are also an ERC-20 token!
        ERC4626()
    {
        asset = _asset;
    }
}
```


We're importing the necessary contracts and making our MySimpleVault inherit from ERC4626 (the standard!) and ERC20 (because our shares are tokens).  We define our asset and initialize it in the constructor.
8/ Implementing totalAssets() â€“ The Heart of the Vault
This function is absolutely critical. It tells the world how much of the underlying asset our vault is holding. In our super simplified example, it's just the vault's balance:

```solidity
    function totalAssets() public view override returns (uint256) {
        // Super simple version! Just the vault's balance of the underlying asset.
        // In a *real* vault, this would include any yield earned!
        return asset.balanceOf(address(this));
    }
    function _asset() internal view virtual override returns (ERC20) {
        return asset;
    }
```

We are also overriding the internal _asset() function.
Remember, in a real-world vault, totalAssets() would need to calculate the total value, including any yield generated from fancy DeFi strategies.

9/ The Deposit Function (Made Easy...ish)

```solidity
    function deposit(uint256 _assets, address _receiver) public override returns (uint256 shares)
    {
        //preview checks
        require(_assets <= maxDeposit(_receiver), "Deposit exceeds maximum");
        shares = previewDeposit(_assets);
        require(shares > 0, "Zero shares");

        // Transfer the underlying asset from the user to the vault.
        asset.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _assets);

        // Mint shares to the receiver.
        _mint(_receiver, shares);

        emit Deposit(msg.sender, _receiver, _assets, shares);
    }
```

This is what's happening:
 * Check the Limits: We use maxDeposit to make sure the user isn't trying to deposit more than the vault allows.
 * Preview: We use previewDeposit to figure out exactly how many shares the user should get.  This is crucial for accuracy!
 * Transfer the Goods: We pull the underlying asset from the user's wallet and send it to the vault.
 * Mint Those Shares: We create new vault shares and give them to the receiver (the person who deposited).
 * Emit: We send the information as an event.
 * 
10/ The Withdraw Function (Getting Your Crypto Back)

```solidity
    function withdraw(uint256 _assets, address _receiver, address _owner) public override returns (uint256 shares)
    {
        //preview checks
        require(_assets <= maxWithdraw(_owner), "Withdraw exceeds maximum");
        shares = previewWithdraw(_assets);
        require(shares > 0, "Zero shares");
        if (msg.sender != _owner) {
            _spendAllowance(_owner, msg.sender, shares);
        }
        // Burn shares from the owner.
        _burn(_owner, shares);

        // Transfer the underlying asset from the vault to the receiver.
        asset.transfer(_receiver, _assets);
        emit Withdraw(_owner, _receiver, _owner, _assets, shares);
    }
```

This is basically the opposite of the deposit function:
 * Check Limits:  We use maxWithdraw to make sure the user isn't trying to withdraw more than they're allowed to.
 * Preview: We use previewWithdraw to calculate exactly how many assets the user will get back.
 * Allowance Check: If someone else is calling for the withdrawal, we check the allowance.
 * Burn, Baby, Burn: We destroy (burn) the user's vault shares.
 * Send the Crypto: We transfer the underlying asset from the vault back to the receiver.
 * Emit: We let know everyone that the event happened
11/ previewDeposit and previewWithdraw (Simplified Examples)
Here's a very basic idea of how these might look. Real-world implementations would be more complex, handling edge cases and fees:

```solidity
    // Example of previewDeposit (very simplified)
    function previewDeposit(uint256 _assets) public view override returns (uint256) {
        // If no assets are in the vault, 1 asset = 1 share.
        if (totalAssets() == 0) {
            return _assets;
        }
        // Otherwise, calculate shares based on the current ratio.
        return (_assets * totalSupply()) / totalAssets();
    }

     // Example of previewWithdraw (very simplified)
    function previewWithdraw(uint256 _shares) public view virtual override returns (uint256) {
      if (totalSupply() == 0) {
            return _shares;
        }
        return (_shares * totalAssets()) / totalSupply();
    }
```

These functions calculate the number of shares/assets based on the current ratio of totalAssets to the totalSupply of shares. The if totalAssets() == 0 part is super important â€“ it handles the very first deposit and prevents division-by-zero errors.

12/ SECURITY! ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ 

Okay, listen up!  Security is everything in DeFi.  Don't even think about deploying a vault without taking this seriously:
 * AUDITS, AUDITS, AUDITS:  Get your code audited by professional security researchers.  And not just once!  Multiple audits from different firms are your best bet.
 * Rounding Errors:  ERC-4626 is very specific about how rounding should be handled.  Get this wrong, and you could leak funds or create unfair situations.  This is why those previewDeposit and previewWithdraw functions are so important!
 * Reentrancy Attacks:  Guard against these nasty attacks, especially if your vault interacts with other contracts.  Use the "checks-effects-interactions" pattern or reentrancy guards.
 * Oracle Manipulation: If your vault relies on price oracles (to calculate yield, for example), make damn sure those oracles are reliable and decentralized.  A manipulated oracle can drain your vault!
 * Slippage Protection:  Let users set slippage limits!  This protects them from getting a bad deal if the price changes while their transaction is being processed.  maxDeposit and maxWithdraw are your friends here.
 * Emergency Pause:  Have a way to pause the vault (deposits and withdrawals) in case of a critical bug or exploit.  This gives you time to fix things before it's too late.
 * Access Control:  Only trusted addresses should have the power to change critical settings or pause the vault.  Use OpenZeppelin's Ownable or, even better, a multi-sig wallet.
 * Donation Attacks:  Be aware of these!  They can artificially inflate the totalAssets and mess with the value of shares.
 * Front-Running:  Be aware that this can impact users.
 * TESTING, TESTING, TESTING: Write tons of tests! Unit tests, integration tests, fuzzing â€“ the whole shebang.  Test every possible scenario you can think of.
13/ Wrapping Up: You're Ready to Dive In!
